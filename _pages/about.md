When I was in the first grade of elementary school, I experienced 486 computer for the first time, and I fell in love with the computer.
Through special activities at school, I gained various certificates and experienced success and failure. I had fun with assembling computers by myself, formatting them, and experiencing various new versions of the windows. When I was in fifth grade, I wanted to learn computer programming. So, I bought a basic C programming book, at the book store. This was the first time I started to learn computer programming.

Then, I came to middle school, I read many books that I would never understand now in order to understand the concept of pointer. Also, I had a chance to learn programming at so called IT Genius Course. I realized I wasn't a genius. At that time, I wanted to attend a Science High School. But, if I studied well enough to enter such schools, my life would have been hard with a lot of frustration and depression. I found I was not interested in science such as physics or chemistry.

Instead, I had a dream of being a computer programmer. So, I went to Korea Digital Media High School to learn web programming. I learned several programming languages including C, C#, JAVA and graphic-related tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Flash. Unfortuenately, I forgot many things I learned at high school. But, when I try to learn new statistical packages or programming tools, the basic knolwedge about programming has been very helpful in understanding the logic structures and grammar. This experience of learning new languages allows me not to give up and try something challenging. At the meantime, I joined in a start-up club called OKLAB where I tried to develop an iPhone application. I believed that running a business was the only joy of life; However, I believe I am not a person of starting a business since I am a risk-averse person. Nonetheless, I won some small awards at a start-up and programming competition.

By chance, my eyes are opend to the world through TV programs and books covering global poverty and crisis. At the same time, I had a chance to visit the Philippines by participating in a short-term missionary program. I saw their life in a worse environment than I had. After I returned, I decided to change my career goal to international development. I wanted to learn social issues more and contemplated a lot how to live to the fullest.

Later, I entered Konkuk university majoring in Economics. I wanted to learn how to escape poverty. I thought I would be able to solve the world poverty if I learn Economics. The more I learned, the more I felt I know nothing. I wanted to go to development field, but I put it off since I did not think there is nothing I could do. Rather, it was more urgent to develop my knowledge and skills.

My dream was to be an NGO workers. Fortunately, I had a opportunities to visit some low-income countries including Tanzania, Colombia and Malaysia. These experience was really worthwhile for me. I felt many things. I was suprised that I was not interested in the people there, but I was interested in my self-satisfaction of being a person who had a good purpose and motivation. Then, I had stopped to visit other countries for a while.

I have no idea what international development really is. There were too many things I didn't know. I was afraid to judge because it was too difficult to know the correct answer. Since I wanted to broand my perspective, I took many courses in philosophy, history, art and so on. With these courses, I could learn how to live better.

The life of KDI graduate school is the day that I studied without any disturbance. I didn't know that I am really craving for learning. I could learn about a field of research. Still, I am not sure how helpful I will be to other countries. At the same time, I feel great responsibility. Someone could be hurt by my mistake or lack of knowledge. Of course, nobody would be interested in my research, still nobody knows.

In Malawi, I tried to avoid judging the policies the institution had. Rather, I tried to observe what is happening now. The thing I have observed is that people tend to behave based on their incentives. Still, I have no idea how to deal with poverty issue. 보다 효과적인 정책이 필요함을 느낀다.


I have uncomfortable question to me.
What if many low-income countries achieve a similar or higher level of economy to my country?
Do I really feel good? I am not sure. I have no idea why.
Perhaps, I want to be a good person who helps others, while retaining my vested interests.
