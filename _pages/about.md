When I was eight years old, I used the 486 computer for the first time, and I fell in love with the computer. From Then, I started learning how to assemble and repair a computer.  When I was twelve (12), I became interested in developing my own computer program. So, I started learning how to program.  My desire to write my own program let me to enroll at Korea Digital Media High School – specialized high school that focuses on computer programming and digital media. There, I majored in web programing and had opportunities to learn several programming languages including C, C#, JAVA, and graphic-related tools such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. Due to my programming background, whenever I am learning to use new statistical packages like Stata or other programming tools like Latex, my programming language familiarity  has been extremely helpful in understanding such software’s the grammar and algorithm. Moreover, the experience of learning new languages encourages me to try to learn challenging concepts. <br>


For a while, I joined in a start-up club called OKLAB where I tried to develop an iPod application, and I won some small awards at a programming and start-up competition. However, I decided to change my career path. As many people do, I had been thinking about what kind of life I have to live as a Christian. I wanted to be a person who cares about the weak and the poor. I had a chance to visit the Philippines by participating in a short-term missionary program, there; I could see the life in a much sadder state that I knew.  Naturally, I wanted to do something about that - eliminating global poverty. I resolved that if I studied economics, I might just have the capacity to do something about it.<br>


To that effect, I enrolled in Konkuk University majoring in Economics. However, the more I learned, the more I felt powerless. Fortunately, I had some opportunities to visit several low-income countries including Tanzania, Colombia and Malaysia. Though these experiences were quite meaningful to me, there were still too many things I did not know. Hoping that I could get a new perspective, I took many courses in philosophy, history, art and so on. In course of my exploration, I realized that development economics could very well provide the answers that I was look for. Consequently, I decided to go to graduate school to focus on development. <br>


My life at the KDI School has been a satisfactory one. I have been able to study without any disturbance.  Courses such as econometrics and impact evaluation have been fascinating to me thus far.  There are yet still many things to learn, and I continue to be unsure how my new capacity will be beneficial to other countries. Also, I feel a great sense of responsibility. <br>


I worked as a research assistant at Korea Labor Institute since I needed to finance my living expenses. While there, I could see the importance of designing policies appropriately since many people are impacted by government policies. I contributed to the research about wage system in public sector and labor environment of the Information Technology (IT) service sector. Especially for IT service sector, I had a chance to meet many computer programmers and often recalled my teenage years when I dreamt of becoming a programmer. Now, I still like do programming, but I prefer to use it as a tool for my future research. Meanwhile, I had an opportunity to work as a volunteer in Malawi. <br>


In Malawi, I worked in the agricultural sector and cultivated corn at a demonstration plot. I tried to observe what is happening there. What I have observed is that people tend to behave based on their incentives, and it is very difficult to obtain reliable data especially in rural area for some reasons. One example is that beneficiaries conceal their assets or family information to obtain more benefits. I wasn’t expecting that. I felt that other incentives should be devised. Despite the lack of reliable data, I felt that data-based policies should be implemented and objective evaluation should be conducted, though it will be not that easy. Thus, I decided to pursue Econ PhD degree to learn how to do it appropriately. <br>


I am currently working at Korea Development Institute. I have contributed to the publication of KDI Monthly Economic Trends and Quarterly Economic Outlook by analyzing the economic trends of the United States and Japan. Though these countries are certainly not low-income countries, I could learn how to examine the whole economic trends of certain nation. <br>


I have no idea what will be next in my life. <br>
I hope, in any circumstances, that I live my life with full of gratitude. <br>


*In their hearts humans plan their course, but the Lord establishes their steps. (Proverb 16:9)* <br>
*Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances. (Thessalonians 5:16-18)*<br>
